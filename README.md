# jplotexamples

This repository is intended to show how to pull together all the pieces for plotting.

## Installation



## The Pieces

1) `ggplot2` and the grammar of graphics
2) Custom palettes, applied to dataset values
3) Custom ggplot2 geoms / stats / functions
4) Outputs to both html and pdf, controlling size and quality
5) Traceback of figures to data to sources
6) Plot annotations
7) 508 compliance, e.g., alternative text, color-blind friendly colors, low-vision friendly theme elements
8) Maps
9) Ordering (e.g., in stacked bars)
10) Other / rest of world catch-alls

## Workflow

Because its a thing, we need to start with how to have the right dependencies. This repo is a package, and dependencies are described in DESCRIPTION. They are more precisely described in the `renv` lockfile. For work
